Squirtle is one of the starter Pokémon available from Professor Oak at the beginning of the Pokémon Red/Blue games. As a Water-type Pokémon, Squirtle is able to use attacks such as Water Gun and Bubble, as well as the HM ability Surf which allows players to ride on a Pokémon over sections of water. If the trainer chooses to begin their Pokémon journey with Squirtle, their rival will choose Bulbasaur. As Bulbasaur is a Grass-type, he has a elemental advantage over Squirtle. As a Water-type Pokémon, Squirtle is strong against Fire-type Pokémon such as Charmander.
