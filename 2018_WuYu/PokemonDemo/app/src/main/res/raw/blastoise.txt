Blastoise is the final evolutionary stage of Squirtle, and evolves from Wartortle at level 36. It is much larger than Wartortle, with a large shell and water cannons protruding from it's back. These cannons can fire water at very high pressure with great accuracy, doing huge damage to anything they hit. Blastoise looks like a large blue turtle, but like Squirtle and Wartortle it is capable of standing upright on its hind legs and walking. Blastoise is commonly found amongst trainers because of its power and reliability - In the pokemon Anime cartoon Ash's rival Gary has a Blastoise.
