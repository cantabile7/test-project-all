Bulbasaur is classified as a Seed Pokémon. It is well known as one of the three starter Pokémon in Versions Red & Blue, as well as the remakes, Versions Leaf Green & Fire Red. It is the only of the first three starter Pokémon that possesses two types (Grass & Poison). This gives Bulbasaur an advantage over Water, Electric, and Fighting-types, only taking half of the usual damage from these types of moves. It has an even greater advantage over Grass types, only taking 25% damage from attacks of these type. However, Bulbasaur takes double the damage from Fire, Flying, and Psychic-type moves.
