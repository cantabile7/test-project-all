Ivysaur is the evolved form of the Pokémon Bulbasaur. It is slightly larger than Bulbasaur, but still retains the same short, stocky build, and the plant on its back has begun to flower. Ivysaur possesses the characteristics of Bulbasaur as a grass/poison type Pokémon, using attacks such as Razor Leaf, Leech Seed and Vine Whip. Ivysaur evolves into Venusaur at level 36. Like Bulbasaur, Ivysaur gains energy from the sun through the plant on its back. Once enough energy has been absorbed, Ivysaur can use the most powerful grass type attack Solarbeam.
